             We're no strangers to love
             You know the rules and so do I
             A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
             You wouldn't get this from any other guy
             
             I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling

             Inside, we both know what's been going on
             We know the game and we're gonna play it
             
             And if you ask me how I'm feeling
             Don't tell me you're too blind to see
